ITEM DATA:
	Shared:
		MACRO_VARNAME_CLASS				// The item's class
		MACRO_VARNAME_UID				// The item's unique ID
		MACRO_VARNAME_SLOTPOS				// The slot position that this item is in, in format [PosX, PosY] (e.g. inside a container). NOTE: If the value of PosX is negative, the item is in a reserved slot (e.g. a player's weapon slots, or linked items)! See the slotPos enums in macros.hpp
		MACRO_VARNAME_PARENT				// The item's parent object (e.g. the container it is inside of) - NOT its item data! NOTE: For dropped items, this points at the ground holder it's in (even for backpacks!)
		MACRO_VARNAME_PARENTDATA			// The item data of the parent object (e.g. the item data of the container that an item is inside of)
		MACRO_VARNAME_ISROTATED				// Whether or not the control is rotated 90°

	Outside of reserved slots:
		MACRO_VARNAME_OCCUPIEDSLOTS			// Returns a list of slot position variables that are in use by this item (see MACRO_VARNAME_SLOT_X_Y for format). Each occupied slot points back at the item data of the item that occupies it

	Only magazines:
		MACRO_VARNAME_MAG_AMMO				// The amount of ammo left in this magazine

	Only weapons:
		MACRO_VARNAME_ACC_MUZZLE			// Points to the item data of this weapon's muzzle attachment
		MACRO_VARNAME_ACC_BIPOD				// Points to the item data of this weapon's bipod attachment
		MACRO_VARNAME_ACC_OPTIC				// Points to the item data of this weapon's optic attachment
		MACRO_VARNAME_ACC_SIDE				// Points to the item data of this weapon's side attachment
		MACRO_VARNAME_MAG				// Points to the item data of this weapon's primary magazine
		MACRO_VARNAME_MAGALT				// Points to the item data of this weapon's secondary magazine

	Only containers:
		MACRO_VARNAME_CONTAINER				// Points to the container object that this container's item data belongs to. Only used on container objects, as regular items do not have an object associated to them
		MACRO_VARNAME_CONTAINERSIZE			// Returns the size of the container in format [Width,Height] (in slot counts). Includes the last line of slots, even if it has fewer slots than the other ones
		MACRO_VARNAME_CONTAINERSLOTSONLASTY		// Returns how many slots the last line of the container has. Can return anything between 1 and the container size's width (default)
		MACRO_VARNAME_ITEMS				// Holds a list of items that are inside the container. Used to determine what items the container currently has - anything NOT inside this list is not "there" to the inventory! Be cautious with how you use this variable!
		MACRO_VARNAME_SLOT_X_Y				// Used to turn a slot position (X, Y) into a string that can be used as a variable name (for use in setVariable/getVariable)

-------------------------------------------------------
SLOT CONTROLS:

	Shared:
		MACRO_VARNAME_CLASS				// The class of the item inside this slot
		MACRO_VARNAME_DATA				// Points to the itemData of the item in the slot. Also used to determine whether a slot is active (full) or not (empty)
		MACRO_VARNAME_SLOTSIZE				// Holds the size of the slot in format [width,height] (in slot counts)
		MACRO_VARNAME_SLOTPOS				// Holds the position of the slot in format [posX,posY] (in slot counts)
		MACRO_VARNAME_PARENTDATA			// Points to the data of the parent container the item is inside of
		MACRO_VARNAME_UI_CHILDCONTROLS			// Returns a list of all child controls associated with the slot (weapon attachments, text, ammo bar, etc.)
		MACRO_VARNAME_UI_CTRL_HAS_EHS			// Whether or not the slot control already has EHs applied to it (for dragging)
		MACRO_VARNAME_UI_CTRLICON			// Icon control of the slot (if there is an item, it's the class's previewIcon, otherwise it may be a specific default icon path)
		MACRO_VARNAME_UI_ISBEINGDRAGGED			// Whether the control is being dragged. Only used on the original control that was clicked on (which goes invisible upon starting dragging), NOT on the control that follows the cursor (that one can be fetched via MACRO_VARNAME_UI_DRAGGEDCTRL)!

	Only Regular slots:
		MACRO_VARNAME_ISROTATED				// Whether or not the control is rotated 90°
		MACRO_VARNAME_UI_CTRLPARENT			// Points to the slot control of the parent container (e.g. an item slot inside a backpack points at the backpack's slot control)

	Only reserved slots:
		MACRO_VARNAME_SLOT_X_Y				// Used to turn a slot position (X, Y) into a string that can be used as a variable name (for use in setVariable/getVariable)
		MACRO_VARNAME_UI_DEFAULTICONPATH

	Only container slots:
		MACRO_VARNAME_UI_ALLSLOTFRAMES			// Returns a list of all slot controls under this container slot control (e.g. all item slot controls inside a backpack)

	MACRO_VARNAME_UI_HIGHLITCONTROLS
	MACRO_VARNAME_UI_ALLOWEDCONTROLS
	MACRO_VARNAME_UI_FORBIDDENCONTROLS
	MACRO_VARNAME_UI_NEXTUPDATE_GROUND			// Saves the time when the next ground UI update is scheduled (polling nearby items). Time is based on the `time` command and is evaluated each frame
	MACRO_VARNAME_UI_FORCEREDRAW_GROUND			// Used to forcefully update the ground UI when, as an example, an item's size was changed (so all items need to be sorted again)
