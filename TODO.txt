TODO:
- Fix ui_update_weapons and ui_update_storage recreating child controls on slots that haven't changed!
- Find a way to determine which control the mouse cursor is currently on
- Fully implement dragging functionality so it actually works (actually moving things around in inventories)
- Add a global scale multiplier (macro) for slot pictures?
- Detect changes done to the actual inventory container (outside manipulation via e.g. scripting commands)
- Search for "TODO" and "DEBUG" comments and address them





DONE:	(top: most recent)
- NVGs/Binoculars should be counted as part of the item category
- Add child controls support for weapon attachments
- Optimise the functions that use namespaces by only checking for the namespace if the result wasn't found
- Make a generateWeaponAccData function to generate the item data for weapon accessories (and loaded magazines)
- Generate data on items in the weapons menu (assigned items, weapons, NVGs, binoculars, etc.)
- Unify namespace variable names using macros
- Write two new config functions to fetch a weapon's magazines array and a magazine's max ammo count
- Tweak the generateContainerData function to fill the item data with actual item info (magazine capacity, weapon attachments, etc.)
- Distinguish between more categories:
	* Unifoms
	* Vests
	* Backpacks
- Convert weapons menu to use generateChildCOntrols
	* Remove built-in icon controls and associated macros
	* Modify weapons/medical menu events to hide the new child controls correctly
- Add a fillbar to magazine items if they have more than one bullet
- Rewrite the dragging code to accomodate for multiple child controls, irrespective of scale, offset and count
 	* Also consider a way of detecting the "main" icon control (1st item in array?)
	* Finally, decide on default icon paths for various inventory items (magazines, grenades, attachments, etc.)
- Remove dragging controls from inventory.hpp (and their corresponding macros)
- Automatically generate inventory data for unknown containers when opening the inventory screen
- Figure out the inventory data format
	* Generate UIDs for every item
	* Store a minimum of 3 entries in the item data:
		+ UID
		+ classname
		+ slot position
	* Generate inventory slots layout automatically (for not-yet-processed containers)
- Make use of getClassSlotSize in ui_dragging_init event to scale the controls accordingly when dragging
- Figure out why weapon controls can't be dragged further than the bottom of the inventoy screen (and get stuck)





FAILED:
- When dragging, dynamically set the focus on the control group that the mouse cursor is over (so that scrollbars work)
