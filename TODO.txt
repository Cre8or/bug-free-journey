TODO:
- Make use of getClassSlotSize in ui_dragging_start event to scale the controls accordingly when dragging
- Add a global scale multiplier (macro) for slot pictures





FAILED:
- When dragging, dynamically set the focus on the control group that the mouse cursor is over (so that scrollbars work)





DONE:
- Figure out why weapon controls can't be dragged further than the bottom of the inventoy screen (and get stuck)
