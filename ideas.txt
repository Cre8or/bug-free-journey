MAGAZINE PRIORITY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A system that allows the player to define the order in which his weapon's magazines will get loaded when pressing
the reload key, aswell as complimentary magazine status display when reloading.

By default, the game should pick the magazine with the remaining bullets from the uniform/vest (not backpack - because
of this, a custom system is required where magazines are spawned in on-demand, as there is no way to override the
default reload action).
There should be an action in the inventory screen (on every weapon, and for every muzzle) which, when pressed,
highlights all matching magazines in the uniform/vest. By clicking on them, the player can set the order in which
he wants the magazines to be reloaded.

Alongside this, a small HUD element should come up whenever the player is reloading (similar to ACE3's magazine check
UI) showing all magazines for the current muzzle and their ammo status.
Independently from the magazine priority, holding down the reload key for longer than ~0.5 seconds should enable the
player to scroll through this list of magazines, always highlighting the currently selected one. When releasing R,
the weapon should then load that specific magazine.

Possible issues:
- What if the player has 3 magazines but only selected 2 for the reoading priority? Auto-assign the remaining ones
	based on their ammo capacity?
- Showing the magazine ammo status could be considered as OP, since it gives you more information than vanilla A3;
	is this a valid concern? If so, how to balance it?

INDEPENDENT INVENTORY SYNCHRONISER
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A system that detects differences between the custom inventory data and the actual inventory, and irons them out.

Something that's needed for various reasons, such as mod interaction, scripting support and handling hardcoded engine
actions (reloading, healing, putting explosives, etc.). Essentially a script that runs in scheduled environment and
repeatedly iterates through the player's inventory data and matches entries to the actual inventory.

If the *custom* inventory is missing something (best case), we simply generate the item data for the new item.
However, if the *actual* inventory is missing something (worst case), we need to get rid of an item from our custom
inventory, aswell as all the unique data that's saved on it - but which one do we delete?

We can't use the indexes as assigned by e.g. 'weaponsItemsCargo' because there are ways to modify those
(delete all items and re-add them in a different order, all in one game tick).
For magazines, we can iterate through the ammo counts to minimise the losses (still not exact if there is more than
one match).
For weapons, we can iterate through the attachments and loaded magazines. Still not exact, but good enough.
For items, we're essentially screwed, because there is no way to tell them apart. Simply delete the first/last one?
For clothing and similar items, same as above.

Also, when iterating through containers (vests, uniform, backpack) - how do we go about adding just *one* item?
We can't use 'generateContainerData' because that would destroy existing data, so we need a custom function,
e.g. 'updateContainerData' or 'refreshContainerData' that considers existing item data.
Also, what if - assuming the "best case" scenario from before - the new item doesn't fit in the container (due
to unlucky placement of items)? Delete it from the actual inventory?

CRAYON CANDLES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apparently, crayons are made of wax. Stuck in the dark? Pop a crayon and you can see for a couple minutes!





-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RENAMING ITEMS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using a sharpie or a thick marker of some kind, it's possible to rename any item (except for the marker itself).
Maybe implement a size limit, and/or scale the durability consumption to the slot size of the item?

FIREPLACES INSIDE HOUSES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crafted fireplaces should require stones, and/or generate smoke which can suffocate players inside buildings.
Some houses may have existing fireplaces, which use a chimney (so no suffocation risk) and are already built.
